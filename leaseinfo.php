                <h4>Genesis of a new office rental formula</h4>
                <p>
                    As a professional therapist in private practice since 1993, I can appreciate the needs of new, part-time or relocating coaching, consultants and mental health 
                    professionals. In reviewing the traditional Seattle office rental/lease options that are often available, they are confined to only the rental of blocks of time only during 
                    certain hours or certain days. Often times these are days or blocks of times that do not match the practitioner's needs but which the contractor is liable to pay for even if they are unable to use them. My thought is that it would make more sense for practitioners to be able to purchase blocks of hours that they can then use whenever they want based on available rooms during that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Seattle class A building suite of offices is composed of:
                <ul class="ml-4">
                    <li>- Nine associate-sized offices (10ftx10ft)</li>
                    <li>
                        - All rooms have sweeping city and bay views
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    n order to guarantee the greatest availability of offices with the greatest 
                    arrangements, each office is uniquely configured. This allows for the widest spectrum of therapeutic arrangements.
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul class="ml-4">
                    <li>
                        - All offices are configured for individual, couple or family use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - One office is configured specifically for children or adolescents, and is also 
                        excellent for hypnotherapy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scheduling conflicts are minimal since membership is limited to keep office 		reservations flexible.
                    </li>

            <h4>Office Lease fee structure</h4>
            <p>I created a fee structure that charges providers by the aggregate of hours they use rather than by blocks of days. Under this fee structure, you pay for a total of hours rather than a block of days or set times. Sixty minutes beginning on a clock hour (e.g. 5pm), or any fraction thereof, is considered one hour.</p>
            <ul class="ml-4">
                <li>- $125.00 for the first 24 hours.</li>
                <li> - $100.00 each additional 12 hours.</li>
                <li>- 6 month agreements or lease options available</li>
                <li>- Available 7 days a week - no scheduling restrictions.</li>
            </ul>   
            <h4>How would I schedule?</h4>
            <p>Upon signing a rental agreement, you will receive a user name and password for the www.downtown-seattle-counseling.com website calendar and forum. Each room has its own calendar page for the month. To schedule a client you need only to browse room calendar pages for the day and time that works best for both you and your client. You would then use your user name and password to book the time you need on the desired day, room and time.</p>
            <p>You have the ability to move edit or request a deletion of a reservation a minimum of 24 hours prior to appointment.
                You have the ability to insure booking stability for a client by making a repeating reservation for the same time, same day same room on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly or monthly basis for as far out as you would like the repeat to continue.</p>
